This project contains a collection of tests that can be used
with twopence.

A farthing is a quarter of a pence, or an eighth of a twopence.
Pretty small change :-)

To run these tests, you need these projects from
https://github.com/okirch:

 - twopence
 	This is a low-level library and server that helps
	with accessing systems under test

 - susetest
	Primarily a collection of higher-level python bindings that help
	with writing test scripts

 - twopence-provision
 	Scripts for provisioning test nodes according to
	test metadata.

 - farthing
 	The repository you're currently looking at, containing
	a number of test cases


The simplest way to run a test is

  twopence run-test --platform <platform> <name>

	This will provision the required topology (currently as
	vagrant nodes), run test indicated test, and tear
	down the topology.

	The test report will be stored below ~/susetest/logs

	run-test supports several additional command line options. A
	rather useful one may be --interactive, which stops after
	each step, allowing the user to connect a test node,
	etc.

Available platforms can be displayed using

  twopence list-platforms
